            <p class="description">The Snowshoe cat is an affectionate, playful, and intelligent breed known for its striking white paws, which resemble "snowshoes," and its short, smooth coat. These cats are highly social and enjoy being around their human companions. They are curious and active, often getting into playful mischief or exploring their environment. Snowshoes are also known for their love of water and will often play in or near water sources. They form strong bonds with their families and are good with children and other pets, making them a great addition to any home.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Snowshoe breed originated in the 1960s when a Siamese cat with white paws was bred with American Shorthairs, giving rise to the breedâ€™s signature appearance.
