            <p class="description">The Munchkin is a distinctive and charming breed known for its short legs and energetic personality. Despite their small stature, Munchkins are incredibly playful and active. They enjoy running, climbing, and playing with toys, and they are often described as "cat-like" dogs due to their eagerness to engage in activities. Munchkins are affectionate cats who love attention and thrive in a social environment. Their fun-loving nature makes them great companions for families and individuals alike.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Munchkin's short legs are the result of a genetic mutation that causes the growth plates in their long bones to close prematurely.
