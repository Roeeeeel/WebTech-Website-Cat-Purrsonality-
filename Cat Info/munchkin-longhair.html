            <p class="personality"><strong>Personalities:</strong> Playful, Affectionate, Curious</p>
            <p class="description">The Munchkin Longhair is a unique and adorable breed known for its short legs and long, flowing coat. These cats are playful, affectionate, and full of energy. Despite their shorter stature, Munchkins are agile and enjoy playing and exploring their surroundings. They are very social cats who love to be around their human companions and are known for their curiosity and intelligence. The longhair variety has a soft, luxurious coat that requires regular grooming, but they are well worth the effort thanks to their charming personalities.</p>

                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Munchkin breed was named after the small, "munchkin" characters from the Wizard of Oz, thanks to their short legs.
