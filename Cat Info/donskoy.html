            <p class="description">The Donskoy, also known as the Don Sphynx, is a unique, hairless breed originating from Russia. These cats are known for their warm, suede-like skin and their friendly, outgoing nature. The Donskoy is highly intelligent and forms strong bonds with its family, often following its owners around the house. Their curious and playful demeanor makes them a joy to be around, and they thrive on human interaction.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Unlike other hairless breeds, the Donskoyâ€™s lack of fur is caused by a dominant gene, making it unique among cats.
