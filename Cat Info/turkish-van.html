            <p class="description">The Turkish Van is a striking cat breed with a long, silky coat and a characteristic pattern, often referred to as the "Van pattern" â€” white with colored markings on the head and tail. Known for their love of water, Turkish Vans are often called "swimming cats." They are playful, adventurous, and energetic, enjoying interactive play and exploration. Despite their independent streak, Turkish Vans are affectionate and will bond closely with their families, often seeking attention on their own terms. Their intelligence and curiosity make them quick learners, and they tend to be confident in new environments.</p>
