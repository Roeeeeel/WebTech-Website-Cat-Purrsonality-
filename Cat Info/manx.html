            <p class="description">The Manx is a unique breed, easily recognizable by its lack of tail or its very short tail. Known for their round faces and large, expressive eyes, Manx cats are also known for their playful and affectionate personalities. They are intelligent and curious, often getting into everything and exploring their environment. Despite their independent nature, Manx cats are extremely loyal and form strong bonds with their families. They are also very agile and skilled at jumping, making them excellent climbers and hunters.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Manx breed originated on the Isle of Man, where they were originally prized for their hunting ability and were sometimes referred to as "rabbit cats" because of their tendency to hunt rodents.
