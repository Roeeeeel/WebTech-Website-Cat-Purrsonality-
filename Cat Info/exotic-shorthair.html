            <p class="personality"><strong>Personalities:</strong> Calm, Affectionate, Playful</p>
            <p class="description">The Exotic Shorthair is a charming and adorable breed, known for its round face, plush coat, and sweet disposition. Similar in temperament to the Persian, the Exotic Shorthair has a calm and affectionate nature, making it an excellent companion for families and individuals alike. These cats are known for their playful side, though they prefer to relax and cuddle with their humans rather than engage in overly energetic activities. Their short, dense coat requires minimal grooming, making them an easy-care option for those who love the look and feel of a Persian without the extra maintenance.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Exotic Shorthair was bred to have the same sweet, gentle temperament as the Persian, but with the convenience of a short coat.
