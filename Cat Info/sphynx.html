            <p class="description">The Sphynx is a unique and striking breed known for its hairless appearance, though it does have a soft, peach-fuzz-like coat. This breed is highly social and loves human attention. Sphynx cats are affectionate, often seeking out warmth and cuddles from their owners. Energetic and playful, they enjoy interactive play and being the center of attention. Despite their lack of fur, they are not hypoallergenic, as they still produce oils that can cause allergies in some individuals. Their outgoing and curious nature makes them excellent companions for families or individuals who can provide them with plenty of love and attention.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Sphynx breed originated in Canada in the late 1960s when a hairless cat was born to a domestic shorthair cat, and breeders worked to develop the breed over time.
