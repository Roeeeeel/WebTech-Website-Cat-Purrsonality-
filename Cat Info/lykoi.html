            <p class="description">The Lykoi, often referred to as the "werewolf cat," is a striking and unique breed known for its partial hairlessness, giving it a wild appearance. Despite its unusual looks, the Lykoi is a friendly and affectionate cat that enjoys interacting with its human companions. They are active, curious, and intelligent, often getting into everything and exploring their environment. Lykoi cats are known for being playful and social, making them great pets for families. Their hypoallergenic coat requires regular grooming to maintain, but their engaging personalities make them well worth the effort.</p>
