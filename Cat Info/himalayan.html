            <p class="description">The Himalayan is a stunningly beautiful breed known for its luxurious long coat and striking blue eyes. A cross between the Persian and Siamese breeds, the Himalayan has inherited the best of both worlds— a calm, affectionate nature and a stunning appearance. They are typically quiet and gentle, making them ideal companions for people who enjoy a laid-back, loving pet. Himalayans are highly affectionate, and they form strong bonds with their families. Despite their calm demeanor, they enjoy playful moments and appreciate interactive playtime.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Himalayan is also known as the “Colorpoint Persian” due to its color-pointed fur, which resembles the Siamese cat, but with the long, luxurious coat of a Persian.
