            <p class="description">The Minuet Longhair is a delightful and sweet-tempered breed known for its distinct round face and long, luxurious coat. These cats are affectionate and enjoy being around their human companions, often following them around the house. Minuets are playful but gentle, and they are typically good with children and other pets. Their calm and easy-going nature makes them great companions for families and individuals who are looking for a cuddly, yet lively, cat.</p>

                <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Minuet Longhair was developed by crossing the Munchkin with longhaired breeds, resulting in a cat with short legs and a beautiful long coat.
