            <p class="description">The Ragdoll is a large, gentle breed known for its relaxed temperament and affectionate nature. They are often described as "puppy-like" due to their love for following their owners around and being held. Their striking blue eyes and silky, semi-long coat add to their charm. Ragdolls are highly social cats and tend to get along well with other pets and children, making them ideal family companions.</p>
