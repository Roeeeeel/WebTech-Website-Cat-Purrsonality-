These cats are friendly, curious, and playful, making them excellent companions for families, children, and other pets. The LaPerm Shorthair's coat, while shorter than the longhaired variety, still retains the distinctive curls that make them so unique. They are intelligent and love interactive play, often seeking attention and cuddles from their human companions. Their laid-back yet curious nature makes them easygoing and adaptable to various environments.</p>
