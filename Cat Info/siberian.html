            <p class="description">The Siberian cat is a robust and friendly breed, known for its thick, triple-layered coat that protects it from cold climates. These cats are highly affectionate, forming strong bonds with their families. Siberians are social and enjoy spending time with their human companions, often following them around the house. They are also intelligent and playful, making them quick learners and great interactive playmates. Despite their large size and powerful build, they are gentle and patient, especially with children and other pets.</p>
